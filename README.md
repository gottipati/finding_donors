# Finding Donors for CharityML (Udacity MLND)

## Project Overview
Developed an efficient supervised machine learning model to classify a person having income more than $50000 or not from the given census data
- Data Set : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income
- Technologies used : Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

Things I have learned by completing this project:
- How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
- How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.
